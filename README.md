# MVD: Enhancing Multi-Class Vulnerability Detection via Attention-Based Graph Neural Networks (Under review)

## Highlights
- We propose EVD, an enhanced vulnerability detection approach which combines attention-based graph neural networks and multi-class minority oversampling to support vulnerability type prediction.
- We conducted our experiments by comparing EVD with both popular deep learning-based approaches and traditional static vulnerability detectors. The experimental results show that EVD is more effective to identify both vulnerable functions and corresponding vulnerability types than the state-of-the-art approaches.
- We contributed an enlarged multi-class vulnerability dataset to open-source community for broader dissemination.

## Implementation
The implementation details of our approach is coming soon.
